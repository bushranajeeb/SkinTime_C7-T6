# SkinTime_C7-T6

A model is designed that can classify the skin disease when a photo is sent through a smartphone. Running algorithm which identifies skin diseases when a picture is provided is attached in the form of python code. 

We basically took a pretrained model (MobileNet in this case) and add a few layers that we trained ourselves in order to determine if the picture contains any of the 7 different conditions. We tried to create a balanced training group and a realistic validation group.
